# Building Transformer Models with Attention
## Implementation from Scrath in Tensorflow Keras

Following [this book](https://machinelearningmastery.com/transformer-models-with-attention/) to teach myself about transformer in depths.

Other excellent resources I come across along the way:
* [Illustrated Guide to Transformers Neural Network: A step by step explanation](https://youtu.be/4Bdc55j80l8) - by Michael Phi [@LearnedVector](https://github.com/LearnedVector)
* [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out.](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY) - by the legendary Andrej Karpathy
